https://www.berlin-vegan.de/map/

# Requirements

* Install a recent version of Node.js
* Change directory to `angular/`

# Installation

 ```
npm install
```

# Run

```
npm start
```

In case your default browser does not open the app automatically, navigate to http://localhost:4200/.

Note that for this command, IE11 is not supported. (same for other legacy browsers)

# Build

```
npm run build
```

Alternatively (including lint):

```
npm run verify
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

In order to manually test the build, run:

```
npm run serve-build
```

This also works for IE11.

In case your default browser does not open the app automatically, navigate to http://localhost:8000/.

# Build and Deploy

## Staging

```
sh deploy.sh
```
